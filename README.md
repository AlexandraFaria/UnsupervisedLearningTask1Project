# DLBDSMLUSL01 - Unsupervised Machine Learning and Feature Engineering

## Task 1: Mental Health in Technology-related jobs

***

## Goal: 

The goal of this project is to analyze a large dataset containing information about mental health in technology-related
companies.  The evaluation requires using Unsupervised Machine learning techniques to form clusters of similar
participants. Once the clusters are formed, visualizations of the clusters and their profiles are used to provide 
deeper understanding of the main principals of the data set. 

### Project Format

3 notebooks were used in order to improve readability and separate stages of analysis.

# 1. Data Cleaning
data_cleaning = 'Task1DataCleaning.ipynb'

# 2. Encoding, Scaling, PCA, and K-Means
data_analysis = 'Task1DataAnalysis.ipynb'

# 3. Feature Importance
data_feature_importance = 'Task1FeatureImportance.ipynb'
